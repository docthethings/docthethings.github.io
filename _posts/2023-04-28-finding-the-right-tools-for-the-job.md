One of the most important things to remember when starting any new "thing" is that the people who have been doing for it for a while are likely privy to any number of tools that make their lives significantly easier. In my life working in IT support and systems administration, my 'Tools' folder was home to countless applications, scripts, and installers. It was a library I'd curated for *years* and there's no way of quantifying just how much 

When you go into technical writing, it's not difficult to imagine being able to cast all that aside. After all, they're just documents, right? Give me a licensed copy of Office and I should be good to go! It doesn't take long too realize that **nothing** could be farther from the truth.

>Like any profession, technical writing has its own tools that make the work faster and more efficient. And, like any profession, it takes time to create the toolset that works best for you. 

### Enter VS Code

There are a number of text editors available for the Mac (my platform of choice) that are fully capable of presenting a comfortable workspace to the human viewing the screen. At the same time, most technical writing and documentation needs to be formatted properly. To do that, I've chosen to focus most of my efforts on utilizing Markdown to the best of its abilities.
